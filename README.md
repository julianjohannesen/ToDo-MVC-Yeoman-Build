#ToDoMVC Yeoman Build

## What is this?

This build of the [ToDoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) app was created using Yeoman and the Fountain webapp generator by following the tutorial found on the [Yeoman tutorials page](http://yeoman.io/codelab/). 

The entire purpose of this sample build is to familiarize myself with Yeoman and its generators.

I created this sample build after finishing Udacity's somewhat dated course [Web Tooling and Automation](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892).

## Specifics

The build was created using React, Redux, Redux Local Storage (as a plugin for Yeoman), React Router, and CircleCI.

The build also inlcudes Autoprefixer, Babel, BrowserSync, ESLint, Jasmine, Karma, PhantomJS, Webpack and few other tools. (Take a look in package.json for a list.)
